Python Streams Playground

An interactive Streamlit app to explore Python Streams â€” from basics (text, images) to advanced (compressed files, large CSV datasets).
This app demonstrates how to process data efficiently using streams instead of loading everything at once.

    ðŸ“„ Text Streams â†’ Read .txt / .csv files line by line
    
    ðŸ–¼ Image Streams â†’ Upload and display images using binary streams
